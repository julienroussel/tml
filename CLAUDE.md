- **Description**: A personal workspace for magicians — organize repertoire, plan setlists, track practice, refine performance over time.
- **Core features**: Repertoire (trick CRUD + tags), practice logging, goals & drills, setlist planning, performance tracking, continuous improvement, inventory (props, books, gimmicks).
- **Production URL**: https://themagiclab.app/
- **Hosting**: Vercel. Licensed GPL-3.0.

## Verify Before Cite — Anti-Hallucination Protocol

Before asserting any factual claim about this repo, verify it. "Remembered from training data" is never sufficient.

- **File path, symbol, or API signature** → check with `mcp__codebase-memory-mcp__search_graph` / `get_code_snippet` first; fall back to `Grep` or `Read`. Do not paraphrase from memory.
- **Library availability** → before suggesting any new dependency, grep `package.json` first. Many useful libs (`radix-ui` umbrella, `react-email`, `resend`, `cmdk`, `sonner`, `@hookform/resolvers`, `culori`, `web-push`, `@vercel/firewall`) are already installed.
- **Version-sensitive API** → re-read `## Version-Specific Rules` below, then confirm the installed version in `package.json` before quoting any syntax.
- **HTML / CSP / SSR output shape** → run `pnpm build` and inspect real output. Source-level reasoning has missed production realities before (memory: `feedback_verify_against_real_build.md`).
- **Tool / MCP existence** → never call `mcp__foo__bar` or assert a slash command exists without confirming its schema is in the current `<functions>` block (or load via `ToolSearch` first). `InputValidationError` follows otherwise.
- **Memory recall vs current state** → if a memory entry cites a file path, symbol, branch, or version, grep/read it before acting. The "X days old" reminder tells you the snapshot age — newer snapshots ≠ current truth.
- **"Why does X behave that way?" answers** → cite `file:line` (use `mcp__codebase-memory-mcp__get_code_snippet` or `Read`). Don't paraphrase from training data.
- **"Done" claim on non-trivial work** → call `advisor()` before declaring complete. Cheap validation (sync drift, i18n drift, migration journal monotonicity) runs automatically in the Stop hook; code-level correctness is still yours.

## Tools & Skills

Surface area available in this repo. Reach for these before hand-rolling.

### MCP servers (configured in `.mcp.json` + global)

| Namespace | Use for |
|---|---|
| `mcp__codebase-memory-mcp__*` | Code discovery — `search_graph`, `get_code_snippet`, `trace_path`, `query_graph`, `get_architecture`. **First grep per session is gated to this** (see `~/.claude/hooks/cbm-code-discovery-gate`). Fall back to `Grep`/`Read` only for non-code text. |
| `mcp__neon__*` | Neon Postgres — list/describe projects, run SQL, prepare migrations, query tuning. Use for schema introspection over `psql`. |
| `mcp__shadcn__*` | shadcn registry — `list_items_in_registries`, `view_items_in_registries`, `get_add_command_for_items`. Use before adding any UI primitive. |
| `mcp__next-devtools__*` | Next.js docs lookup, dev-time browser eval, framework upgrade helpers. |
| `mcp__docs__*` | PowerSync docs (HTTP MCP). Use for sync-rules / connector questions. |

### Slash commands (in `.claude/commands/`)

- `/verify` — full validation suite (`lint` + `typecheck` + `test:run` + `sync:check` + `i18n:check`) in parallel. Run before declaring done on non-trivial work.
- `/real-build-check` — `pnpm build` + inspect actual `.next/server/app/**/*.html`. Use **before** planning anything CSP/HTML/SSR-shape-dependent.
- `/stale-check` — audit CLAUDE.md claims against repo state.
- `/memory <topic>` — grep memory files and print bodies inline (faster than re-reading every entry).
- `/why <path>` — git log + memory entries for a file.

### Skill-backed workflows (in `.claude/skills/`)

Skills with `paths:` frontmatter auto-load only when matching files are open. Descriptions always surface in the `/` menu, so natural-language requests still discover them.

- **`/migrations`** — full schema-change workflow (Drizzle → review SQL → migrate → sync codegen → docs). Path-scoped to schema/migration files.
- **`/sync-engine`** — diff Drizzle vs PowerSync schemas; detect drift. Path-scoped to sync/schema files.
- **`/i18n`** — add translation keys across all 7 locales (ICU + completeness). Path-scoped to messages + components.
- **`/notifications`** — push + email notification system. Path-scoped to push/email/sw paths.
- **`/new-feature`** — scaffolds feature dir, schema, migration, sync artifacts, route, translations, components (empty/loading/error states), tests, module registry, CSP, docs.
- **`/powersync`** — sync rules / connector / offline patterns guidance.
- **`/shadcn`** — adding/composing shadcn components.
- **`/ultracite`** — Biome+Ultracite lint/format troubleshooting.
- **`/next-cache-components`** — Next.js 16 Cache Components (PPR, `use cache`, `cacheLife`, `cacheTag`).
- **`/next-upgrade`** — Next.js version upgrades + codemods.
- **`/neon-*`** — `neon-auth`, `neon-drizzle`, `neon-serverless`, `neon-toolkit`, `neon-js`, `add-neon-docs`.

Auto-loaded only (not slash-invocable): `next-best-practices` (App Router conventions). Run `ls .claude/skills/` for the full list.

## Commands

Full script list: `pnpm run`. Project-specific gotchas:

```bash
pnpm sync:generate    # REQUIRED after any src/db/schema/** change — regenerates PowerSync artifacts
pnpm sync:check       # Fail if sync artifacts drift (pre-commit + CI gate)
pnpm i18n:check       # Validate all 7 locales share the same keys
pnpm docs:generate    # Regenerate public/llms{,-full}.txt + docs/diagrams/
```

Requires Node 24.x and pnpm ≥ 10.

## Architecture

### Stack

Pinned versions in `package.json`. Opinionated choices that aren't obvious from the lockfile:

- **shadcn/ui (new-york style)** built on the umbrella `radix-ui` package — never `@radix-ui/react-*` subpackages.
- **PowerSync direction**: offline-first SQLite is the **primary read source**; Neon is downstream. Don't bypass.
- **Sync codegen**: `src/sync/schema.ts` and `powersync/sync-config.yaml` are **generated** from Drizzle. Never hand-edit.
- **Style utility**: `cn()` in `src/lib/utils.ts` (CVA + clsx + tailwind-merge). Use for every conditional-class case.
- **Lefthook** (not Husky) for pre-commit; **Vitest** (not Jest); **Biome via Ultracite** (no ESLint/Prettier).

### Route Groups

- `src/app/(app)/` — authenticated routes (dashboard, repertoire, collect, settings, account, feature modules). Protected by `proxy.ts`. Dynamic. `/repertoire` and `/collect` are enabled Library modules; other feature routes exist but their modules are `enabled: false` until launch. `/account/[path]` uses `AccountView` from Neon Auth.
- `src/app/(marketing)/[locale]/` — public pages (landing, FAQ, privacy). URL-based locale routing, `generateStaticParams` for all 7 locales (21 pages). Bare paths (`/faq`, `/privacy`) are 302-redirected by `proxy.ts` to locale-prefixed. `/` redirects authed users to `/dashboard`, others to `/<locale>` landing.
- `src/app/auth/` — sign-in / sign-up. Dynamic (reads `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie). Authed users → `/dashboard`.
- `src/app/api/` — route handlers (PowerSync upload, auth, unsubscribe, etc.).

### Server Actions

- `"use server"` at file top + `import "server-only"` to block client bundling.
- `await auth.getSession()` at the top of every action.
- Non-blocking post-response work → `after()` from `next/server`. Never `setTimeout`/fire-and-forget in serverless.

### Module Registry

`src/lib/modules.ts` — 4 groups (`MODULE_GROUPS`):
- **Library**: Repertoire (enabled), Collection (slug `collect`, enabled)
- **Lab**: Improve, Train, Plan, Perform (all disabled)
- **Insights**: Activity (enabled), Enhance (disabled)
- **Admin**: Admin (disabled)

Use `getModulesByGroup(group)`.

### Event log

User-facing activity history + canonical product analytics. Table `event_log`, synced per-user via PowerSync (13 synced tables total). Renders at `/activity` and via the `RecentActivityCard` on `/dashboard`.

**Dual-sink emission rule.** Domain mutations emit to two sinks: `trackEvent()` (`src/lib/analytics.ts`) for funnel dashboards in Vercel, and `logEvent()` / `logEventServer()` (`src/lib/events/`) for the canonical per-user history. Both calls live in the same mutation hook / server action, and **both must be added together** for any new domain mutation. The `event_log` table is the source of truth — Vercel Analytics is a convenience layer.

Client mutations always wrap the event-log write in `safeLogEvent()` (`src/lib/events/log.ts`), which calls `logEvent` inside the surrounding PowerSync `db.writeTransaction(...)` and routes any failure through `reportEventLogFailure`. The event row is **co-located** with the action — a successful event rides the same sync queue and replays offline — but the dual sink is **best-effort on the event side**: an event-log CHECK violation, schema mismatch, or downstream outage must never roll back the primary mutation. The primary table is the source of truth; the event log is the canonical activity history but not load-bearing for correctness. `logEventServer` writes directly to Neon from server actions, route handlers, and `auth/ensure-user.ts` (typically via `after()` so it doesn't block the response). Event taxonomy lives in `src/lib/events/types.ts`. See `docs/features/activity.md` for the full reference.

### DB grants & roles

Two Postgres roles exist on Neon. Today, **all server-side code paths use `neondb_owner`** — Drizzle (`src/db/index.ts`), server actions, route handlers including the PowerSync upload route (`Pool({ databaseUrl })` at `src/app/api/powersync/batch/route.ts:180`), `logEventServer()`, and `auth/ensure-user.ts`. `neondb_owner` has full DB access and bypasses RLS, so **anything sensitive must be guarded at the application layer**.

The `authenticated` role is currently exercised only by the JWT-aware client paths the codebase does not yet use directly (Neon Data API, JWT-forwarded PowerSync sync — both anticipated, not active). Migration `0020_lockdown_authenticated_grants.sql` (issue #245) hardens what `authenticated` CAN see/do **before** any code path actually authenticates as that role:

- Schema `public` has **no default privileges** for `authenticated`. Every `CREATE TABLE` synced via PowerSync MUST include an explicit `GRANT <subset> ON <table> TO authenticated;` line in the **same migration file**. Future synced tables added without a GRANT will be invisible to any future `authenticated`-role client (PowerSync queries return empty).
- The canonical per-table grant matrix lives in `0020`. Reference shape:
  - Standard user-data tables (12): `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE`.
  - `push_subscriptions`: `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE` — no `DELETE` for clients (cleanup of expired subs is server-side).
  - `event_log`: `SELECT, INSERT` + column-level `UPDATE (deleted_at, updated_at)` only — no `DELETE`, no payload mutation. Audit-trail invariant.
  - Server-only tables (`users`, `user_preferences`): `SELECT` only.

**The 422 gate in `src/app/api/powersync/batch/route.ts:122-144` IS still the only enforcement of the `event_log` audit-trail invariant on the live write path** — because that path runs as `neondb_owner` and bypasses both the new `authenticated` GRANTs and RLS. Do not weaken or remove the 422 gate without first migrating the upload route to a JWT-forwarding `authenticated`-role connection. The DB GRANT lockdown is forward-positioning + hardening against an accidental `DATABASE_URL` swap to a less-privileged role; it is not a replacement for the application-layer check today.

### Key Directories

- **`scripts/`** — codegen and ops CLIs: `generate-sync.ts`, `check-sync.ts`, `check-i18n.ts`, `generate-docs.ts`, `generate-screenshots.ts`, `powersync.ts`, `setup.ts`. Entry points behind the `pnpm sync:*`, `pnpm i18n:check`, `pnpm docs:generate`, `pnpm screenshots` scripts.
- **`src/features/<name>/`** — active feature modules with `components/` and `hooks/`: `collect`, `enhance`, `improve`, `perform`, `plan`, `repertoire`, `settings`, `train`.
- **`src/test/`** — `factories.ts`, `mocks.tsx`, `render.tsx`, `error-boundary.tsx`.
- **`.claude/audit-*.{json,md}`, `review-baseline.json`, `review-profile.json`** — outputs of the `review-swarm` multi-reviewer audit flow. The baseline caches fresh lint/typecheck/test status for 10 minutes.

---

## Platform Preferences

- **Prefer Vercel-native features** over third-party when available on the current plan (Vercel WAF rate limiting over Upstash, Vercel KV over external Redis, Vercel Cron over external schedulers). Justify any third-party choice by why Vercel's offering is insufficient.
- **Environment detection** → `VERCEL_ENV` (not `NODE_ENV`). `NODE_ENV` is `"production"` in both prod and preview deployments.

---

## Plan Mode

- **Default plan-mode exit mode is `acceptEdits`, NOT `bypassPermissions`.** When invoking `ExitPlanMode` in this repo, pass `mode: "acceptEdits"` so file edits auto-approve under plan approval but Bash and MCP-tool calls still respect `permissions.ask` in `.claude/settings.json`. This is load-bearing — the `ask` list (migrations, destructive Neon ops) is the second line of defense after the user's plan review, and `bypassPermissions` would silently skip it. Reserve `bypassPermissions` only for plans the user has explicitly tagged "no further prompts" within the same turn — never as a silent default. Why: a prior PR shipped an `event_log` migration via plan-mode bypass and applied it to dev/julien without per-command consent; the recovery required `mcp__neon__reset_from_parent`. The `ask` list cannot defend against `bypassPermissions`; this rule closes the loophole.

---

## Version-Specific Rules

Never suggest or use deprecated patterns for any of these.

### Next.js 16

- **`proxy.ts` not `middleware.ts`** — `middleware.ts` does not exist in Next.js 16. Proxy config export must NOT use `as const` (Turbopack can't statically parse it).
- **Async dynamic APIs** — `cookies()`, `headers()`, `params`, `searchParams` are async and must be awaited. `const { slug } = await params`.
- **React Compiler** — `reactCompiler: true` at top level in `next.config.ts` (NOT under `experimental`). Never write `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or `React.memo` — the compiler handles it.
- **Metadata API** — `export const metadata` / `generateMetadata`. Never `next/head` (doesn't exist in App Router).
- **Caching** — `fetch()` is not cached by default. Use `{ cache: 'force-cache' }` or the `"use cache"` directive. `unstable_cache` is deprecated.
- **Config** — `reactCompiler`, `devIndicators`, `serverActions` are top-level, not under `experimental`.

### React 19

- **`ref` is a regular prop** — never use `React.forwardRef`.
- **`use()` hook** — read promises and context in render.
- **`useActionState`** replaces deprecated `useFormState`.
- **`useFormStatus`** is from `react-dom`, not `next/...`.
- **Server Actions** are stable — no `experimental.serverActions` flag.

### Tailwind CSS v4

- **No `tailwind.config.js`** — theme is CSS-first via `@theme inline { ... }` in `globals.css`.
- **`@import "tailwindcss"`** — not `@tailwind base/components/utilities`.
- **PostCSS plugin** is `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
- **`@custom-variant`** replaces JS `addVariant` plugins. Content detection is automatic.
- **Colors use oklch**. Tokens are CSS custom properties mapped via `@theme inline`. Never `theme.extend`.
- **Class renames from v3** (apply mechanically when porting): `shadow-sm`→`shadow-xs`, `shadow`→`shadow-sm`, `ring`→`ring-3`, `blur`→`blur-sm`, `rounded`→`rounded-sm`, `outline-none`→`outline-hidden`.

### Biome & Ultracite

- **No ESLint, no Prettier, no Stylelint** — never suggest installing or reference their configs.
- **Commands**: `pnpm lint` / `pnpm fix`. Not `npx eslint`, `npx prettier`, or `pnpm dlx ultracite`.
- **Import sorting** is handled by Biome's `organizeImports`.
- **`biome.json`** extends `ultracite/biome/core` and `ultracite/biome/next`.

### Vitest

- **Not Jest** — `vi.mock()`, `vi.fn()`, `vi.spyOn()`. Never `jest.*`.
- **Config**: `vitest.config.mts`. **Setup**: `vitest.setup.ts`.
- **Imports**: `describe`, `it`, `expect` from `vitest`. Not `@jest/globals`.
- **Async tests**: `async/await`. Never `done` callbacks.

---

## TypeScript Standards

- **No `any`**. Use `unknown` and narrow explicitly.
- **No loose typings** — avoid `object`, `{}`, `Function`.
- **Explicit return types** on exported functions and public APIs. Inferred OK for local helpers when unambiguous.
- **Modern type-level TS**: discriminated unions, `satisfies`, `as const`, template literal types, branded types for domain IDs (`UserId`, `TrickId`).
- **`interface`** for extensible object shapes; **`type`** for unions/intersections/computed.
- **Generic constraints** as narrow as possible.
- **No type assertions** (`as X`) unless unavoidable — prefer type guards.
- **No `@ts-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error`** without an explanation and tracking issue.
- **Exhaustive checks** — `never` in switch/if to catch unhandled cases at compile time.
- **Functional style over classes**. Factory functions returning object literals.

## Code Quality Standards

These complement Biome — they cover what the linter cannot enforce.

- **Business logic correctness** — Biome can't validate algorithms or domain rules.
- **Meaningful naming** — descriptive names for functions, variables, types, files.
- **Architecture decisions** — component boundaries, data flow, API shape.
- **Edge cases** — boundary conditions, empty/null/error states, race conditions.
- **Accessibility** — semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard nav, screen reader support.
- **Security** — validate user input, avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, sanitize at system boundaries.
- **Early returns** to reduce nesting; extract complex conditions into named booleans.
- **Throw `Error` objects** with descriptive messages — never strings; never catch just to rethrow unchanged.
- **Tests**: assertions inside `it()`/`test()`; no committed `.only`/`.skip`; flat `describe` nesting.

## Test Strategy

- **Co-located**: `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`.
- **Coverage threshold**: 80% global (statements/branches/functions/lines).
- **Test utilities** in `src/test/`: `factories.ts`, `mocks.tsx`, `render.tsx`, `error-boundary.tsx`.
- **Don't test**: shadcn/ui primitives, layout wrappers, CSS, E2E flows, performance, third-party APIs.
- **Mock boundaries**: DB via `vi.mock`, PowerSync API surface, push/email sending.

## Path-Scoped Rules

Detailed reference material lives in `.claude/rules/` and auto-loads when matching files are read:

- **Sync engine** (`.claude/rules/sync-engine.md`) — generated artifacts, write/read paths, codegen + deployment. Loads on edits to `src/sync/**`, `powersync/**`, `src/db/schema/**`. Or invoke `/sync-engine`.
- **Migrations** (`.claude/rules/migrations.md`) — single-file + monotonic-timestamp safety rules. Loads on `src/db/schema/**`, `src/db/migrations/**`. Or invoke `/migrations`.
- **i18n** (`.claude/rules/i18n.md`) — locale list, namespace conventions, completeness check. Loads on `src/i18n/**` and components. Or invoke `/i18n`.
- **CSP** (`.claude/rules/csp.md`) — builder + test-against-real-build rule. Loads on `src/lib/csp.ts`, `public/sw.js`. Or invoke `/real-build-check`.
- **New feature** (`.claude/rules/new-feature.md`) — always loaded; concise checklist. Or invoke `/new-feature`.

**Always-applicable: offline-first is load-bearing.** App must boot with no network after first load; PowerSync's SQLite is the primary read source. `public/sw.js` must cache PowerSync WASM + workers under `/@powersync/`. Memory: `project_offline_first.md`.

## UI/Design Conventions

- **Mobile-first**: design for <768px first, then 768–1024px, then >1024px.
- **Touch targets**: min 44x44px (`min-h-11 min-w-11`). Never `xs` button on mobile.
- **Animations**: sub-200ms, functional only. Use `motion-safe:` to respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Empty states**: Icon + title + description + primary CTA. Use `ModuleComingSoon` pattern.
- **Loading states**: skeleton for cold start only — offline-first means data is usually instant.
- **Error states**: Error boundary with retry.
- **Mobile nav**: bottom tab bar (<768px) — Dashboard, Repertoire, Plan, Perform, More.
- **Desktop nav**: sidebar.
- **Accent color**: Violet (oklch hue 280). **Always use theme tokens** from `globals.css`, never arbitrary colors.

## LLM Discovery

- `public/llms.txt` and `public/llms-full.txt` — generated from `docs/` via `pnpm docs:generate`. CI fails on staleness. `robots.txt` allows crawling.

## Escalation & Memory

- **`advisor()`** — call for non-trivial work before committing to an approach, and before declaring done. Sees the full transcript and catches direction drift.
- **Auto-memory** at `~/.claude/projects/-Users-jroussel-dev-tml/memory/` is loaded every turn via `MEMORY.md`. Stores "why" context (past incidents, preferences). Memory entries should ADD information (incident dates, prior decisions, external context), never duplicate rules already in this file. Use `/memory <topic>` to recall focused entries mid-task without burning context on the full set.
- **Validation hooks** auto-run on Stop:
  - `pnpm sync:check` if `src/db/schema/**` changed.
  - `pnpm i18n:check` if `src/i18n/messages/*.json` changed.
  - `pnpm typecheck` if any `.ts`/`.tsx` outside tests/scripts changed.
  - Migration journal monotonicity if `_journal.json` changed.
- **PostToolUse** emits edit-time advisories on schema, i18n, migration, CSP, service-worker, `next.config.ts`, `package.json`, and `src/proxy.ts` edits. Heed the nudges — they encode past failure modes.
- **Manual checks**: `/verify` (full suite), `/real-build-check` (production HTML), `/stale-check` (CLAUDE.md vs repo), `/memory <topic>` (recall focused entries), `/why <path>` (git log + memory for a file).

## Follow-up Tracking

Review follow-ups live as GitHub Issues with the `review-followup` label. `gh issue list --label review-followup`.
